# Welcome to Neurograph

Neurograph is a graph deep learning library. This library is still in the early phases of development and will evolve over time. This started out as a toy project for learning graph theory and deep learning. Currently it's core library written in C with high level usage in Python. 

## Purpose

* Experiment and research algorithms in graph theory and understand it's applications
* Tie concepts from graph theory to deep learning
* Data manipulation tool that utilize graph representations
* Invent a new graph neural network architecture
* Framework to visualize graphs


## Design

* `mkdocs serve` - Start the live-reloading docs server.
* `mkdocs build` - Build the documentation site.
* `mkdocs -h` - Print help message and exit.
