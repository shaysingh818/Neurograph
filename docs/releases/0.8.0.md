### Data Structures

* Create array data structure with reallocation logic

### Extractors

* Frame to matrix conversion for training models
* Handle frame row limit counts greater than the rows in the file itself
* Handle blank values in csv file with regex
* Refactor the regex library (based on handling blank values)
* Refactor unit tests to test each method of the frame library (be more thorough)

### Deep Learning

* Add batch size training for frames in Neural Net training
* Train models using selected columns for data frame
* Save and load trained models for neural nets
* Train on row by by row basis instead of feeding the entire matrix
* Trained sample model on iris dataset
