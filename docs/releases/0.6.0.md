## V 0.6.0


### Data Structures

* Create an array based implementation for the set data structure
	* Needs to handle whether it's only looking for unique character or integer values
	* Array should resize dynamically
* Replace code for generating unique node ID's with set implementation

### Graph Library 

* Use asserts for the graph library unit tests
	* Remove repetitive if statements 
* Thoroughly test serialization of graph markup language files
	* Allow entries for directed and non directed graphs
	* Replicate results for similar graphs in depth and breadth first search test cases
	* De-Serialize in memory graphs to markup files
	* Add labels and weights entry in graph markup files
* Create a shared interface that can be applied for both matrix and list represented graphs
	* Shared method for adding nodes
	* Printing out nodes and relationships in a graph
	* Serializing and de-seralizing to markup files
* Migrate all matrice graph methods to adjacency matrix structure

### Deep Learning 

* Read/learn about convolutional neural networks
	* Program a convolution operation for a layer

### Remove

* Eliminate unique linked list implementation
	* Replace existing use cases with the hash set data structure
	* Use hash map with out application key value
* Remove item structure from queue
	* It's redundant, replace with the node structure instead

### General Issues

* De serializing graphs doesn't fully work as expected
	* Labels that have quotes within them won't be written to the file
	* This is due to the fact that the regex extracts values between the quotes
	* Need to remove quotes from label nodes and neighbors during serialization process
