# V 0.7.0

### Deep Learning

* Refactored computation graph to work on operation level
* Created methods for arithmetic and basic matrix operations
* Defined general methods for operations backward and forward pass
* Created general definition of a `value` in the computation graph
* Flushed out logic for how loss functions will be added to computation graph
* Created general union abstraction around layer types for neural nets
* Implemented basic multi layer perceptron with newly refactored computation graph
* Added layer implementations for activation and linear concepts
* Refactored neural network library
* Added network methods for training and adding layers

### Graph Library 

* Added integration tests for GMUL file interpretation

### Extractors

* Added row limit for data frame structure
* Integration tests for how many rows a data frame can load

### Pipeline

* Refactored pipeline workflow
* Separated build and test steps for core package
