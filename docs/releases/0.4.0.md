# V 0.4.0

* Release structure has features covered for each category/module of neurograph
* Categories are separated based on
	* Data Structures
	* Extraction
	* Graph Library
	* User interface
	* Deep Learning

### Data Structures
* Save and load model parameters
	* Integrate these functions with neural network library
* Finish all unit tests for matrice library 
* Implement a unique set data structure (tree based approach)

### Data Extraction
* Redesign CSV reading and keep track of header and column counts
	* Rewrite frame to graph conversion
* Create module for regular expressions
	* Single match
* Data frame to graph conversion

### Deep Learning
* Create Computational graph for back propagation
* Create network with multiple hidden layers

### Graph Library
* Community detection
	* Label Propagation (Iterative)
	* Works with up to 2 specific label classes currently
* Add general matrix structure as part of the matrix graph representation
* Triangle count

### User Interface
* Expose these functionalities from the graph library
	* Searching algorithms (DFS, BFS)
	* Path Finding (Shortest Path, Dijkstra, Weighted Random Walk)
* Expose these functions from the queue library
	* Initialization
	* Push, Pop and printing queue values
* Demonstrate these in a jupyter notebook

### Fixes and Improvements
* Documented steps for all graph theory algorithms 
* Cleaned up makefiles 
	* Removed repetitive commands in the build process
	* Making use of wildcards for header files
* Ditched the csv library 
	* Replaced with generic data frame library
