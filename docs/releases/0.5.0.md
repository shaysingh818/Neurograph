# V 0.5.0

### Data Structures

* Implement a hash map library 
	* Create POC, avoid collisions at all costs
	* Throw exceptions for key lookup that don't exist
* Improvement and fix for the adjacency list data structure
	* Detect unused slots in the graph 
	* Don't allocate more nodes that aren't needed for both unweighted, weighted and directed/un-directed graphs
	* Use array of pointers for node_list structure, use arrow deference for head pointer
* Matrix library
	* Add method for getting columns of matrix `to_cols`
	* Allow option for batching a matrix and selecting a certain amount or rows

### Data Extraction 

* Add hash map as attribute for data frame
	* Replicate similar methods for getting cols and rows
* Create a prototype of GML (graph markup language)
	* Create a regular expression for parsing this type of file format
	* Create an interpreter that can serialize files
	* Will not do weighted graphs in this version

### Deep Learning

* Refactored computation graph to forward and backward all node types
* Added refactored computation graph representation to network module

### Graph Library

* Make all random walk methods use the walk structure 
	* Easier to use on the python front end
* Create general graph structure that makes use of data structures
	* Include the adjacency list and matrices as inherited attributes
	* Add attribute for keeping track of labeled nodes
* Label propagation with multiple classes
	* Should work with more than two labels
	* Discovered that graph markup serialization doesn't work here
