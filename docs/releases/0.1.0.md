# V 0.1.0
* Support CSV graph ingestion for the following graph representations
    * Weighted/Unweighted
    * Added parameters for directed or non-directed
* Be able to represent graphs abstractly using the following structures
    * Adjacency List (Weighted, Unweighted, Directed, Un Directed)
    * Adjacency Matrix (Weighted, Unweighted, Directed, Un Directed)
* Ability to convert graphs between different structural representations
    * Adjacency Matrix → Adjacency List
    * Adjacency List → Adjacency Matrix
* Support feature(header) extraction of csv files.
* Generate unique character labels for each node that is created in any type of graph representation
* Fixed initial memory leaks
	* Added compilation tasks for checking memory leaks
* Graphs should have these algorithms implemented.
